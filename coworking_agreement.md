## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?* Olga has no needs. Amanda has no needs. 

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We agreed to prioritize working together during designated class sessions and work on parts of the project by ourselves if we need to. 

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Amanda has preference for hands-on approach and reach out to instructors when needed. Olga likes to be proactive and solve problems fast when they arrive. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Amanda welcomes any kind of feedback as long as it leads to better results. 
Olga welcomes any kind of feedback too. We both understand that we are still learning and growing in this field.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Open communication is always a good area to focus on.
